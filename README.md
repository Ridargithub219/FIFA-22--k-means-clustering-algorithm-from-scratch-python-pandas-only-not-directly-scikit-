# FIFA-22--k-means-clustering-algorithm-from-scratch-python-pandas-only-not-directly-scikit-
In this project, we'll build a k-means clustering algorithm from scratch (using python and pandas). K-means is one of the most popular forms of clustering.(using python and pandas).I'll then compare it to the reference implementation from scikit-learn's KMean algo.
